## 💻 What I Do

I write backend code—mostly in **Java with Spring Boot**.  
Currently working at **L&T Technology Services** since September 2023, helping build stuff for a digital health platform. Things I touch include:

- Spring Boot magic + MongoDB and PostgreSQL  
- Testing with JUnit, Mockito, and Postman  
- Kafka, ELK stack, and a splash of AWS  
- Agile rituals, Jira dashboards, and too many meetings  

I also have knowledge of Python, C, and JavaScript. I know—strange combination.  
I’m also working on building a guide for Spring Boot. Check it [here 🌐](https://aniketripathi.github.io/spring-boot-guides/)

## 🎮 Outside the Code

- 🎮 I mostly play single-player and strategy games that let me explore, plan, or break the rules a little. Titles like ⚔️ *Elden Ring*, *Witcher*, *DOOM*, *Company of Heroes*, *Deus Ex*, and *Civilization* always pull me in. I don't play multiplayer now except *Left4Dead2* and I did spend a lot of time on *CS 1.6* back in the day.
- 🎬 I’m always up for a good movie or show. I watch everything except pure drama and enjoy underrated stories, some foreign films, and series that make you think. Horror movies are my go-to at night — mostly to see if they still manage to get under my skin.
- 🎭 I occasionally watch anime — mostly action, mystery and story-driven ones like *One Piece*, *One Punch Man*, *Attack on Titan*, *Chainsaw Man*, *Solo Leveling*, and *Death Note*.
- 📊 I'm curious about how things work — especially finance, machine learning, and anything that flips standard logic on its head.
